What is Koii (KOII)?
Koii transforms ordinary computers into a unified, AI-ready computing network through K2‚Äîa high-performance Layer 1 blockchain forked from Solana, positioning itself as the leading DePIN.



The network's core protocols‚ÄîSCALEs (Succinct Curated Acyclic Ledger Extensions) and CARP (Compute Attribution and Reputation Protocol)‚Äîenable efficient distribution of computing tasks and automated validation across thousands of nodes. Koii's task framework allows developers to deploy in any programming language, while the KPL token standard enables projects to launch their own compute-backed tokens.


By creating a marketplace where anyone can contribute computing power, Koii reduces infrastructure costs by up to 90% compared to traditional cloud providers, while ensuring node operators earn rewards for their contributions. This creates a sustainable ecosystem where advanced computing becomes accessible to all.
